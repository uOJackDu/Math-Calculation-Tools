Some simple calculation tools I wrote in Grade 12.

I know it's not very efficient, but can be useful in doing quick computations.
Capable of providing help in the following math calculations.

quadratic-and-simple-geometry-2d.py:

Quadratic functions - root, y-intercept, vertex
2D points - distance between a point and a point, find quadrants
2D lines - slope, y-intercept, intercetin between a line and a line, perpendicular bisector
2D vectors - addition, subtraction, scaling, dot product, normal vector
Triangles - perimeter, area, translation, reflection, centroid, orthocenter, circumcenter
Circles - perimeter, area

polynomial-and-vectors-3d.py: 

polynomial functions - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivatives
rational functions - derivative, asymptote
3D vectors - addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, magniude, projection, check orthogonal
3D lines - distance between skew lines, distance between a point and a line, distance between a point and a plane, distance between a line and a plane, intersection between a line and a plane
